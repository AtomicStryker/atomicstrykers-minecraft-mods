 * Usage of this class:
 * You can use this Interface to create your own Dynamic Light Sources to use with Dynamic Lights.
 * Implement this interface, write code as you see fit, and then use the method:
 * 
 * DynamicLights.addLightSource(IDynamicLightSource yourLightObjectHere) to get Dynamic Lights to use it.
 * 
 * When you want your Light to turn off, simply call
 * 
 * DynamicLights.removeLightSource(IDynamicLightSource yourLightObjectHere)
 * 
 * 
 * You could also just return a Light Level <1, but that would leave your Light in the aggressively iterated List -
 * please do not do that.
 *
