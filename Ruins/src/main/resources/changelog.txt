8.5
+ added possibility to place custom Mob ID MobSpawners (only manually!)
# Example 6: rule1=0,100,315-0'Villager
# This spawns a custom Mob Spawner (315) with Mob Id "Villager" (and metadata 0) 100% of the time

8.6
+ dumped the hardcoded 300-311 and 315 block IDs in favor of a string based system, see template_rules.txt
+ OLD TEMPLATES USING ANY OF THESE WILL NOT BE COMPATIBLE. DELETE YOUR OLD FOLDER AND CONVERT YOUR TEMPLATES
+ included templates are already converted
+ relevant part of template_rules.txt:

#        /*
#         * Conversion table from old Ruins 8.5 template style to new 8.6+ style
#         * 
#         * Just handling the part where you used to specify 'special' blocks
#         * Full Example: "rule1=0,25,310" turns into "rule1=0,25,MediumChest"
#         * 
#         * 300 -> preserveBlock
#         * 301 -> MobSpawner:Zombie
#         * 302 -> MobSpawner:Skeleton
#         * 303 -> MobSpawner:Spider

#         * 308 -> HardMobSpawn
#         * 309 -> EasyChest
#         * 310 -> MediumChest
#         * 311 -> HardChest
#         * 315-0'Villager -> MobSpawner:Villager
#         * 
#         */
# As of 8.6, you can also specify a Block Name instead of it's numeric ID! This should be
# very useful to use Ruins with other Mods and changible Block IDs. Make sure to use the
# absolute Blockname, not the translation! Example: "44-2" can also be written as "stoneSlab-2"

8.7
+ update to MC 1.4.6

8.8
+ synchronized World Generation Hook, also made sure the 0,0 chunk doesn't ever spawn anything

8.9
+ unleashing the custom rotation config file! You should now be able to use any and all blocks
  for your Ruins, if you make rotation mappings for them.
+ read /mods/resources/ruins/rotation_mappings.txt for information and examples
+ to facilitate the figuring out of block names and metadata, Ruins will now print out the
  relevant information about a block ingame if you tap it with a "stick".
  
8.9 (second rev)
+ fixed tiny possible crash with empty lines in template parser. Old versions remain compatible.

9.0
+ added option for chests filled with MC ChestGenHook loot (see template_rules.txt)
+ added a small chance (1/25) for dungeon loot to be put into "loot" chests

9.1
+ forced biome folders to always-lowercase, maybe helps mod biome issues
+ (rename your old template folders to be all-lowercase)

+ subsequently found and fixed errors in 2 default templates

9.6
+ added generation for the End (Biome "sky")

9.6 (second coming)
+ disabled spawning in Chunks at 0,0 and the 2 adjacent chunks altogether

+ fixed consecutive Biomes bug in 2 more places

10.0
+ update to MC 1.5.2

10.1
+ made Ruins logic distinctly and concurrently per-world and atomic, should fix server Dimension oddness
+ disabled Ruins excessive logging by default. You can re-enable it in ruins.txt in your world save directory

10.1b
+ moved the recursive generator check back into the main mod from per-world logic, does not seem to catch with multimc

10.2

+ moved biome variable printout to logging, to be disabled as such when needed

12.0
+ update to MC 1.7.2
+ all previous templates are incompatible, im afraid
+ i've subsequently dumped the schematic converter
+ the included templates have been updated to the new values, see credits file
+ many thanks to Saeldur for doing this

12.1
+ added Ruins support for signs with text on them
+ added Ruins support for skulls/heads
+ fixed mappings: trapdoor, tripwire, repeater, comparator, furnace, chest,
+   dropper, wodden button, activator rail, quartz stairs, piston, dispenser,
+   cocoa, anvil, fence gate, end portal frame, all log types, quartz pillars
+ glorious rebirth of the template converter, now ingame admin command "/parseruin"
+   does not require the client to have Ruins installed
+   upon execution, saves the result template on the server(!) in the "templateparser" biome folder
+   converter supports custom mob spawners and command blocks, also custom signs
+   does not support chest content (is replaced by dungeon chestgenhook, 5 items)
+   converter has basic support for any block, even mod blocks, and their meta values
+   note for full support of mod block rotations you might have to add rotation mappings for them
+ also adds testing command "/testruin" which can be used to spawn any ruin template
+   any template is specified by "biomefolder/filename" (SERVERS FOLDER!)
+   or just "filename" when the template is located in the "templateparser" biome folder
+   you may also append an optional rotation digit [NESW = 0123] to test template rotation

12.2
+ added Ruins support for any IInventory block with any Block/Item specs
+ see template_rules.txt for details and examples
+ Ruins ingame parser now supports reading and saving IInventory containers and contents
+ yes this does in fact include mod added chests and mod added items

12.3
+ changed IInventory block syntax, 12.2 cant work unfortunately
+ fixed some errors in IInventory system
+ fixed some bugs with TileEntity blocks not rotating correctly

12.4
+ fixed issue where Ingame Ruin Parser could not parse more than 1 instance of each special blocktype

12.5
+ fixed issue where Ingame Ruin Parser could not parse negative coordinates in Command Blocks

12.6
+ fixed several issues with special characters (Command Blocks, Mobspawners, Signs)
+ added logging and best-effort Entity Mapping to Mobspawner Entity IDs
+ improved ingame template parser for torches, buttons and signs, now setups delayed spawns correctly to fix "popping off"

12.7
+ made acceptable_target_blocks optional, can also be left empty
+ such a template will accept any surface
+ also added optional unacceptable_target_blocks, works as complement to acceptable_target_blocks
+ changed template parser default to wildcard acceptable_target_blocks and just add water and lava to unacceptable_target_blocks

12.8
+ added optional slot index number to IInventory lines in templates. Parser will save slots exactly as found.
+ complete rewrite of Building Site algorithm, better and hopefully faster
+   any and all sorts of plants should no longer block Ruins from spawning, at all
+   removed cut_in in favor of max_leveling (which now works both for holes and bumps) and defaults to 2 now
+   new recalculation of site surface should spawn Ruins in places previously found unfit
+   allows setting leveling_buffer=-1 to prevent site leveling (for example for underground templates)
+ positions file now blocks an area around spawn by default
+ ruin spacing increased by default
+ complete revamp of default template set, mostly generic now. Moved others into "optional" and "obsolete" sets

12.9
+ premature optimization probably made the collision detector not work ... brute force it is
+ added world chunk logging to detect IWorldGenerator.generate being called multiple times
+ scrapped "unique" template setting because it never quite worked right. Use templateInstancesMinDistance
+ added sanity checking to height values. Ruins bounds can now only be set starting height 8 and fitting below max world height
+ added optional coordinates to testruin command, can be called from server console with coordinates

13.0 (the shipwreck spam update)
+ adds forge event EventRuinTemplateSpawn
+ adds server command /undoruin which lets you restore the building site of the last /testruin command
+ fixed small issue where templateparser would create unnecessary duplicate rules
+ fixed the underwater shipwreck templates up a bit, added one more
+ minor optimizations, improvements to logging broken templates

13.1 (Command Blocks Rising: Revengeance)
+ Command Block relative coordinates now automatically get rotated when their template is
+ added feature to automatically execute and delete command blocks upon a player coming near (64 block)
+   to use, just take your rulex=0,100,CommandBlock:/summon Villager... and prefix "RUINSTRIGGER " to the command line
+   example: rulex=0,100,CommandBlock:RUINSTRIGGER /summon Villager...
+ by the power of regex, fixed all Ruins templates which had torches without late spawning rules - no more popped off torches
+ Standard blocks in Ruins templates are now set without update, and the entire site updated after. Should help spawning lag a bit.

13.2
+ fixed Command block relative coordinate rotation up a bit (was included in previous hotfix)
+ changed Template Parser to fail if a block/rule cannot be mapped
+   if you are using mod blocks in a template, and the mod is not installed, the template wont attempt to spawn
+ changed Template parsing to read extended Piston heads as delayed spawning Blocks, similar to torches

13.3 (King of imaginary paper)
+ removed some old superfluous code, some unnecessary logging and warnings
+ refactored logging to print less useless data and some more useful things
+ why didn't anybody tell me Ruins demanded clients have it installed since some forge update?! fixed
+  HOTFIX: handler was reading min template distances before file parser had gottem to them

13.4
+ updated to mc 1.7.10

13.5
+ changed distance finding algorithm for detecting nearby ruins, should work better for huge templates and close distances

13.6
+ removed obsolete and fairly expansive bounding boxes overlap check (since there is a min distance check anyway)
+ fixed problems with Ruins event, split it into 2: pre and post event

13.7
+ added allowedDimensions line to per-world ruins config file, does what the name implies
+ refactored a bunch of things, made code cleaner

13.7a
+ reverted a refactoring change that apparently was needed after all

13.8
+ added optional template variable "uniqueMinDistance" which overrides global templateInstancesMinDistance

13.9
+ template parser now also saves minecraft:torch-5 with the EXISTS_BELOW(1) rule
+ fixed event bug related to testing templates
+ fixed template spawning not marking the topmost layer for a world block update (invisible oddness)
+ added optional template variable 'preventRotation=1', which when set prevents a template from being rotated

14.0
+ changed /testruin syntax to /testruin TEMPLATENAME [X Y Z [ROTATION]] - it was: /testruin TEMPLATENAME [ROTATION X Y Z]
+ improved /testruin to accept relative coordinates aka "~x"
+ improved /testruin to work when used by command blocks
+ added server command documentation to readme

14.1
+ consolidated template spawning: now no rule will call block updates before spawning is finished. might fix redstone/piston bugs
+ fixed oddness in /testruin always spawning one y too high (this is for all coordinate types!)
+ fixed Skull Blocks being broken, unfortunately this means the syntax changed
+ from Skull:skulltype:rotation[:playername]-meta to Skull:skulltype:rotation[:uuid-playername]-meta
+ i dont think you can find out uuid by yourself, so use the template parser to get player heads

14.2
+ improved undo command to only save ruin sites BEFORE actually spawning ruins
+ /testruin now also allows to replace the specified y coordinate with "_", which signals Ruins to find a suitable y for given x,z
+ with exactly the same behaviour (flying, underground...) a randomly spawning template would display
+ this y specification may NOT be combined with "~", aka "_~2" will NOT work

14.3
+ fixed command block rule to accept multiple command blocks as alternatives
+ note you cannot mix a command block rule with non-command-blocks unfortunately. command block syntax is too unforeseeable
+ added optional bonemeal flag to IGrowable block rules. just append "-addbonemeal" to an existing plant ruleblock
+ added adjoining_template functionality, see doc for details
+ /undo supports the removal of everything a template with adjoining templates spawned
+ see 143test and adjtest in the templateparser directory for how adjoining_template works

14.4
+ fixed "air" not being processed when preservable blocks were present
+ internal changes. report bugs with old templates!
+ fixed ruin spawning not necessarily causing a clientside block update

14.5
+ updated to MC 1.8, no changes to template format (yet)
+ hotfixed issue with chest generation

14.6
+ fixed snow / snow_layer typo

14.7
+ fixed some more command block parsing errors

14.8
+ fixed IGrowable metadata bug
