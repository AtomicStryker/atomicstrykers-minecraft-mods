# BASICS
# This file is designed to be copied into the mods/resources/ruins folder and be
# edited to create a new template.  It is functional as-is; you can use it as
# a placeholder for future templates after renaming it.
#
# Templates have a .tml extension and the mod will attempt to load any and
# all files with that extension if they reside in the <minecraft root>/
# mods/resources/ruins folder. Whether it does so successfully or not can be
# checked in the log file (<minecraft root>/mods/ruins_log.txt). The mod will also
# load any templates found in the biome folders within
# <minecraft root>/mods/resources/ruins.
#
# These template files are a simple text file; simply open them in your
# favorite text editor to make changes or create new ones.
#
# There are three sections to each template file:
# VARIABLES define how the template is generated.
# BLOCK RULES define how the layers are generated.
# LAYERS tells the mod how to place blocks using BLOCK RULES.
#
# You can specify a comment by placing a "#" character at the beginning of the
# line.  You technically /don't/ have to do this, since the mod only looks for
# particular line starts when loading a template, but I consider it good form 
# because it increases readability and you prevent any errant line reads.


# VARIABLES
#
# biomesToSpawnIn=<name1>,<name2>,<name3>...
# Adds the Template being loaded (regardless which folder it is in) to a Ruins Biome
# found in the Minecraft Biomelist so that <namex> matches the Biome's name.
# If you don't know a Biome's name, find it's folder. The foldername equals the
# Biome name. Case insensitive. A Template cannot be added to a Biome more than once.
# The Template is still added to the corresponding folder it was loaded from (if not already in).
# example: biomesToSpawnIn=forest,foresthills,taiga
# Optional. You can use the folders as before, or use this to save space, or both.
#
# weight=<weight>
# Weight is how much weight this template has during random generation.  When
# the mod asks for a template to place it adds up the weights of all templates
# that are currently loaded and generates a random number based off of that
# total, then checks to see what template to load.  If the mod loads five
# templates with weights 1, 5, 5, 10 and 10, the template with weight 10 has a
# 10 in 31 chance of being generated, while the template with weight 1 has a 1
# in 31 chance of being generated.  A template only has weight in its biome.
# Defaults to 1.
#
# embed_into_distance=<number of layers>
# Specifies how many layers to embed into the target blocks.  This is useful
# for creating basements or dungeons.
# Defaults to 1.
#
# acceptable_target_blocks=<blockID>,<blockID>,<etc...>
# This is a comma-delimited list of block IDs that this template can spawn on.
# Only the top layer of blocks where the template will spawn are checked.
# Optional line. Defaults to accept any block.
#
# unacceptable_target_blocks=<blockID>,<blockID>,<etc...>
# This is a comma-delimited list of block IDs that this template can NOT spawn on.
# Only the top layer of blocks where the template will spawn are checked.
# Optional line. Defaults to accept any block.
#
# dimensions=<height>,<width>,<length>
# Defines how big this template is.  Height is the number         n
# of layers that are used, not the height that sticks out         n
# above the ground.  Width is the north-south width, and       www*eee
# length is the east-west width.  For reference, north in         s
# the template is the top of the text file.                       s
# All default to 0.
#
# allowable_overhang=<overhang>
# Specifies the allowed number of blocks in the potential build site that do not have
# a surface within a reasonable distance, leaving the template "hanging" over an edge
# Defaults to 0.
#
# max_leveling=<leveling>
# Specifies the maximum surface noise / height difference, within the build site,
# that will be accepted when considering a potential build location.
# The site will then be levelled prior to spawning the template.
# If there is overhang allowed, also specifies how much "support" blocks are put
# under the template when building it overlapping a surface edge.
# Defaults to 2.
#
# leveling_buffer=<lbuffer>
# The distance around the build site that will also be levelled.  Values higher
# than 5 will use 5, since the world would otherwise be mangled pretty badly.
# Defaults to 0.
# Ruins 12.8 introduces a setting of -1, which will prevent any(!) site leveling
#
# preserve_water=<yes/no>
# If set to 1 all site checking rules will treat water as air so that the ruin
# can be generated beneath/in water.  Any rules that replace a block with air
# will respect water and not replace it.  If set to 0, water is treated like 
# any other block.
# Defaults to 0/no.
#
# preserve_lava=<yes/no>
# If set to 1 all site checking rules will treat lava as air so that the ruin
# can be generated beneath/in lava.  Any rules that replace a block with air
# will respect lava and not replace it.  If set to 0, lava is treated like 
# any other block.
# Defaults to 0/no.
#
# random_height_offset=<min>,<max>
# Specifies block range in which the Ruin will be randomly shifted up or down
# on an established valid location before actually being built.
# Defaults to 0,0/no random shifting
#
# NOTE: When using preserve_water and preserve_lava it is advised that you
# restrict the cut_in_buffer as much as possible, preferably to 0.  If it is
# more than 0 you may get some unexpected fluid dynamics if the structure
# does not spawn completely in water/lava.
#
# Ruins 13.8 adds optional variable "uniqueMinDistance" which overrides global templateInstancesMinDistance
# uniqueMinDistance=1500
# defaults to 0. values of 0 are handled as if no value was specified at all.
#
# Ruins 13.9 adds optional variable "preventRotation" which keeps a template in the specified direction
# preventRotation=1
# defaults to 0. values of 0 are handled as if no value was specified at all.
#
# Ruins 14.3 adds the optional repeatable variable "adjoining_template" which lets you spawn adjacent templates
# these will not be checked for minimal distances against ANY other ruins, make sure your spacings are big enough
# these will also not be checked for circular dependencies, you build an infinite loop, you wait it out
# these will be checked against the rules the template itself contains
# Ruins will use its spawning algorithm to determine a fitting y coordinate to the xz you provide
# adjoining templates will be randomly rotated, you can disable this in their templates if you want
# syntax: adjoining_template=<template>;<relativeX>;<allowedYdifference>;<relativeZ>[;<spawnchance>]
# <template> is the full filepath relative to the resources/ruins folder, so, working like /testruin
# <relativeX> and <relativeZ> are the relative coords from the host x,z spawnpoint to the adjoining x,z
# <allowedYdifference> states how much the computed adjoining template height may absolutely differ before aborting
# <spawnchance> is optional and does what the name implies, [0-100] values allowed
#
# Example: adjoining_template=generic/MoaiHead;-25;10;25;33
#
# Ruins 17.0 adds optional variables "spawnMinDistance" and "spawnMaxDistance"
# to specify the minimum and maximum distances (i.e., Chebyshev distance, in
# blocks, on the XZ plane), respectively, from the world spawn point this
# template may be naturally instantiated in the overworld (dimension 0). They
# have no effect on instantiation in other dimensions.
# spawnMinDistance=1000
# spawnMaxDistance=5000
# The default values are spawnMinDistance=0, spawnMaxDistance=infinity. For
# both variables, a value of 0 effectively means "no limit" and reverts to the
# corresponding default.
# These settings are overridden by globals "anySpawnMinDistance" and/or
# "anySpawnMaxDistance" when the global values are more restrictive--that is,
# the greater min distance and lesser max distance are used. Note the default
# value of anySpawnMinDistance is 32, not 0; if a spawnMinDistance less than
# that is desired, the Ruins mod configuration file will need to be changed.
# If the space between max and min distances is too narrow (namely, less than
# the length and width of the template), no instances can naturally generate.
#
# Ruins 17.2 adds three new optional variables:
#
# requiredMods=<criterion>
# Prevent installation of this template unless the list of installed mods meets the
# specified criterion--a boolean expression of one or more mod ids and operators (see
# below).
# example: requiredMods=quark+tconstruct  # requires both quark AND tinkers' construct
# Optional. Defaults to no criteria.
#
# biomeTypesToSpawnIn=<criterion>
# Adds the Template being loaded (regardless which folder it is in) to every Ruins Biome
# found in the Minecraft Biomelist for which the Biome's list of types meets the specified
# criterion--a boolean expression of one or more biome type names and operators (see below).
# example: biomeTypesToSpawnIn=DRY,COLD  # spawns in any DRY or COLD biome (or both)
# Optional. May be used in addition to, or instead of, biomesToSpawnIn.
#
# biomesToNotSpawnIn=<name1>,<name2>,<name3>...
# Excludes the Template being loaded from every Ruins Biome found in the Minecraft Biomelist
# with the specified name. Case insensitive. Note this takes precedence over
# biomeTypesToSpawnIn, but do not inhibit Biomes listed as biomesToSpawnIn, nor the Biome
# associated with the Template's folder.
# example: biomesToNotSpawnIn=ice_flats,ice_mountains
# Optional. Only relevant if biomeTypesToSpawnIn is specified.
#
# In both requiredMods and biomeTypesToSpawnIn, some rudimentary boolean operations are
# allowed by concatenating multiple type names separated by + (and) or - (and not). So, for
# example:
# biomeTypesToSpawnIn=forest-cold,jungle+hills
# This adds the template to all biomes that are of type forest AND NOT cold, or are of both
# jungle AND hills. Order doesn't matter, so the following is equivalent:
# biomeTypesToSpawnIn=hills+jungle,-cold+forest
# If all the types are exclusions, all non-excluded types are added. Thus, "-nether-end"
# means every biome that isn't of type nether or end. The comma serves as an "or" operator
# and is of lower precedence than + and -; parentheses may be used to further control the
# order of evaluation.
#
# Ruins 17.3 adds optional variable "dimensionsToSpawnIn" to specify in which
# dimensions the template's structures may appear. Note this applies to generic
# spawning as well. List one or more dimensions by name, separated by commas,
# or leave blank (default) to allow all dimensions.
# example: dimensionsToSpawnIn=overworld,twilight_forest
#

weight=5
embed_into_distance=1
acceptable_target_blocks=stone,grass,dirt,sand,gravel,clay
dimensions=4,7,5

preserve_water=0
preserve_lava=0


# BLOCK RULES
# Each rule must be formatted carefully:
# rule<number>=<condition>,<chance to appear>,<list of blocks>
#
# rule<number>
# The mod does not care what you call these and will number the rules in the
# order they are loaded (sequentially from 1), so long as the line start with
# "rule".  I suggest using "rule#" as a mnemonic, such as "rule1", "rule2",
# "rule12", etc...  Once the templates are loaded, the first rule in the list
# becomes rule #1 for the purposes of building a layer, the second becomes rule
# #2, and so on.
#
# By default, the mod uses a special rule, 0, which defines the Air block with
# a 100% spawnrate and no conditional.  You can use this rule in the layers to
# "blank out" certain areas (providing space for mobs, for instance).  Note,
# however, that rule0 may be redefined as something else by the template author.
#
# <condition>
# A conditional to the block being placed, aside from randomness.
# 0 = Normal, spawns first
# ±1 = Checks block under, spawns delayed
# ±2 = Checks block adjacent, spawns delayed
# ±3 = Checks block above, spawns last
# 7 = Spawns last
# Where the negative cases for 1,2,3 denote NOT. In other words, 2 means the block will only spawn 
# if there is a block next to it, while -2 will NOT spawn if there are any blocks next to it.
#
# Adjacent in this case is not diagonal, only along the cardinal directions.
#
# Adjacent blocks are processed after 0 and 1 conditionals have been placed,
# and "under blocks" are processed after all other blocks have been placed.
# Please note that these blocks are still processed in an order dependent on
# the rotation of the site.  For a normal, north-facing site, the block rules
# are processed for each line from the left and from the bottom template to the
# top.
#
# DO NOT CHAIN CONDITIONS. That results in undefined behaviour.
#
# <chance to appear>
# The chance that this block will appear, out of 100, depending on whether the
# condition above is met.
#
# <list of blocks>
# A comma-delimited set of minecraft blockIDs.  This will determine what block
# will actually spawn in the location.  Each blockID is given the same weight,
# so you can skew the odds of a certain blockID appearing by adding it multiple
# times.  You can specify block metadata by adding a "-<metadata>" after the
# blockID.  For instance, to place a cobblestone stairs block ascending to the
# east, use stone_stairs-3.  To place a wood half-block (slab), use stone_slab-2.
#
# You can find a list of blockIDs and commonly-used metadata via Google.
# There is also one included, idmappings.txt
#
#
# Example 1: rule1=0,100,0,cobblestone,mossy_cobblestone
# This spawns either air, cobblestone, or a mossy cobblestone 100% of the time.
#
# Example 2: rule1=1,50,mossy_cobblestone
# This spawns a mossy cobblestone 50% of the time but only if another block
# is underneath it.
#
# Example 3: rule1=2,100,stone_slab-2,planks
# This spawns either a stone slab or a plank block, but only if there is an
# adjacent block on the same level.
#
# Example 4: rule1=0,100,torch-5
# This spawns a torch standing on the ground.
#
# Example 5: rule1=0,25,MediumChest
# This spawns a Medium Chest (see above) 25% of the time.
#
# Example 6: rule1=0,50,MobSpawner:Villager
# This spawns a Mob Spawner with Entity Id "Villager" 50% of the time
# Entity Id's are case sensitive! Mod added Mobs are allowed. Use a tool like Simply Hax to get correct Entity Id's
#
# Ruins 9.0 exposes minecraft ChestGenHook for your meddling. Usage:
#
# Example 7: rule1=0,100,ChestGenHook:chests/simple_dungeon:10
# This spawns a chest and tells the Minecraft generator to fill it with "10" itemstacks of the "chests/simple_dungeon" loot preset.
# This might include extremely powerful items added by mods. Note: The algorithm spreads out the itemstacks, it might be more than 10
# items in this particular case, e.g. 5 pieces of bread count as 1 itemstack, yet will be spread out over 5 slots.
#
#	see http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Loot_table#List_of_loot_tables for possible loot tables (as of MC 1.9)
#
#	As of 10.6, all chest rules can also append a metadata/rotation int similar to a chest block ID
#	example: rule1=0,100,ChestGenHook:chests/simple_dungeon:10-5
#	for a chest filled with dungeon chest loot and rotated to meta 5.
#
#
# Ruins 10.3 adds Command Block Support. Usage:
# Example 8: rule1=0,100,CommandBlock:command:sender
# command being the Command string to be executed and sender being the Command sender (a player name, Rcon...)
# you can provide several alternative command blocks seperated by commata, however you may not mix command blocks and other blocks in one rule
#
# Ruins 12.1 adds Standing Signs. Usage:
# Example 9: rule1=0,100,StandingSign:a|b|c|d-4
# a,b,c,d are the 4 Strings/lines you can write on a sign. The metadata/rotation of the sign is affixed as usual.
#
# Ruins 12.2 adds IInventory block support. Usage: IInventory;<blockName>;<itemList>-<blockrotation>
# where <blockName> is the registry name of the Block that sports an inventory
# where <itemList> is a list of elements seperated by '+', each element is a block or item registry name
# optionally followed by #stacksize OR #stacksize#metadata OR #stacksize#metadata#inventoryslot
# Example 10: rule1=0,100,IInventory;chest;red_flower+arrow#10+wool#3#15-5
# this spawns a chest rotated to 5, which will contain a single red flower, 10 arrows, and 3 wool of color red (meta 15)
# Example 11: rule1=0,100,IInventory;dispenser;arrow#10+snowball#20+egg#3-1
# this spawns a dispenser rotated to 1, with 10 arrows 20 snowballs and 3 eggs
# you may use this for items added by mods. names not found in the registry will simply be skipped over.
# you may also use this for container blocks added by mods. invalid anythings should be skipped.
# the Ruins Parser will do this for you when you parse an IInventory block. Empty chests get hooked with dungeon loot
# automatically. If you want to prevent this, either edit the template afterwards or place some dirt in the chest.
# if you specify the same slot index multiple times, only the first itemstack gets put in
#
# Ruins 15.0 adds ChestGenHook (see above) as valid <itemList> entry for IInventory rules
# Example: rule1=0,100,IInventory;dispenser;ChestGenHook:dungeonChest:5-1
#
# Ruins 14.3 adds the -addbonemeal flag to use on IGrowable blocks such as saplings or most plants
# simply append -addbonemeal to a block which is an IGrowable (and only those!)
# note this overrides certain checks done before hand application of bonemeal, such as darkness checks for shrooms
# also note /undo does NOT take growing things into account when cleaning up your shenanigans
# below example is for oak and dark oak saplings
# Example 12: rule1=0,100,0,sapling-addbonemeal,sapling-5-addbonemeal
#
# Ruins 14.9 adds support for item NBT data. the json nbt string replaces 'stacksize' in the format, as nbt capable items are never stackable
# Example 13: rule1=0,100,IInventory;minecraft:chest;minecraft:diamond_sword#{RepairCost:2,display:{Name:"Choppa"}}#0#0
#
# Ruins 15.0 adds support for tile entity NBT data. This is best achieved by adding the blockname to the global "teblock" variable in ruins.txt
# Usage: teBlock;<blockName>;<nbttag json>-<blockrotation>
# Example: rule1=0,100,teBlock;minecraft:trapped_chest;{Items:[0:{Slot:12b,id:5s,Count:1b,Damage:0s},1:{Slot:13b,id:24s,Count:1b,Damage:1s}],id:"Chest"}-2
# Note: "Chain" and "Repeat" Command Blocks are classified as such by default
#
# Ruins 16.8 modifies the rule syntax a bit to add some new features (variants and variant groups, in particular). None
# of these changes should break or alter the behavior of existing template files, except perhaps in pathological cases
# exploiting undocumented or unintentional aspects of rule parsing.
#
# * Block Weighting: Instead of repeating block IDs in a rule to manipulate their probabilities of occurrence, weight
# factors may now be used. This can make rules shorter and, in certain circumstances, more efficient. Apply a weight to
# any block in a rule by preceding it with a prefix of the form "n*"; this is functionally equivalent to repeating the
# same block n times. For example, the following rules are essentially identical, each producing blocks of dirt,
# mossy_cobblestone, and gravel with the same likelihood:
#     rule1=0,100,dirt,dirt,mossy_cobblestone,dirt,gravel,dirt,mossy_cobblestone,mossy_cobblestone,dirt
#     rule2=0,100,5*dirt,gravel,3*mossy_cobblestone
# Weights are optional. If no weight is specified for a block in a rule, a weight of 1 is assumed.
#
# * Rule Variants: Consider a platform composed of many instances of the following rule3:
#     rule3=0,100,stone,dirt,cobblestone
# Each generated structure will have a different random assortment of stone, dirt, and cobblestone blocks. Suppose,
# though, what you really want is each platform to be a single, randomly chosen material--either all stone, or all
# dirt, or all cobblestone. You can't do that with a regular rule, since a different material choice is made per block.
# You could do it with three separate templates, of course, but now there's another way. For example:
#     rule4=0,100,stone
#     ^0,100,dirt
#     ^0,100,cobblestone
# Note "ruleXXX=" is replaced by "^" to indicate a line is a variant of the preceding rule, not a separate rule itself.
# Each time a structure with such a rule is generated, one of these variants is randomly chosen to apply to that entire
# structure wherever the corresponding number appears in the layer specifications.
#
# * Rule Variant Weighting: Weights can be applied to rule variants to adjust the probability with which they are
# selected. As with block weighting, a prefix of the form "n*" is placed at the beginning of the variant (i.e., just
# after the = or ^) to assign it a weight. Unlike block weights, however, variant weights must be integers. For
# example, you can use this rule for the windows in your structure:
#     rule6=3*0,100,2*stained_glass-14
#     ^0,100,stained_glass-4
#     ^5*0,100,stained_glass-11
# Most of your generated structures will have blue windows (stained_glass-11, with a weight of 5), a little more than
# half as many will have red windows (stained_glass-14, with a weight of 3), and only a precious few will have yellow
# ones (stained_glass-4, with a weight of 1, the default when none is specified).
#
# * Grouped Rule Variants: With variants, it may be desirable to coordinate several different rules to guarantee
# selections are only made in particular combinations. A named rule specification using ^ instead of = creates a new
# rule whose variant choice depends on that of the preceding rule. For example, make a small pillar with the following
# rule7 at the base and rule8 stacked above it:
#     rule7=0,100,redstone_block
#     ^0,100,gold_block
#     ^0,100,lapis_block
#     rule8^0,100,stained_glass-14
#     ^0,100,stained_glass-4
#     ^0,100,stained_glass-11
# When a structure chooses variant #1 of rule7, it will always choose variant #1 of rule8 as well, so pillars with
# redstone at the base will have red glass (stained_glass-14) on top. Similarly, gold blocks (rule7, variant #2) will
# be matched with yellow glass (rule8, variant #2) and lapis (rule7, variant #3) with blue (rule8, variant #3).
# 
# * Rule Variant Group Duplication: Suppose you have a structure with three fancy pillars, as described in the previous
# example. You could make three stacks of rules7 and 8. Different structures would have different kinds of pillars, but
# all three pillars of any one structure would be of the same type. To get variation within the same structure, you're
# going to need a separate group of rules for each pillar--one using rule7 and 8, one using 9 and 10, and one using 11
# and 12:
#     rule9=0,100,redstone_block
#     ^0,100,gold_block
#     ^0,100,lapis_block
#     rule10^0,100,stained_glass-14
#     ^0,100,stained_glass-4
#     ^0,100,stained_glass-11
#     rule11=0,100,redstone_block
#     ^0,100,gold_block
#     ^0,100,lapis_block
#     rule12^0,100,stained_glass-14
#     ^0,100,stained_glass-4
#     ^0,100,stained_glass-11
# Note these rule groups are identical except for their names, and there's an easier way. By putting a repeat count of
# the form "n*" in front of the first rule name in a variant group (the one with an =), that many identical groups are
# automatically created. This is a bit tricky, because it does create new rules, which affects the way rules are
# numbered. To continue the example, rule7 could be changed slightly to take advantage of this feature:
#     3*rule7=0,100,redstone_block
#     ^0,100,gold_block
#     ^0,100,lapis_block
#     rule8^0,100,stained_glass-14
#     ^0,100,stained_glass-4
#     ^0,100,stained_glass-11
# This creates rule7 and 8 as before, but also creates rule9, 10, 11, and 12 for you, exactly as though these lines had
# been cut and pasted into the template file 3 times. Note rule names are irrelevant--rules are assigned numbers based
# on their ordinal position in the template (the first rule is 1, the second 2, and so on, regardless of their names).
#
# * Alternate Rule 0: By default, rule 0 is an air block. You can now change it to something else by putting an unnamed
# rule at the top of your rule list:
#     =0,100,stained_glass-7,stained_glass-8
# It has to appear before any other rule. It cannot be a variant of a preceding rule (since there isn't one--it has to
# start with = instead of ^), but it can be followed by variants and/or grouped variant rules. It cannot have a repeat
# count.
#
# Ruins 16.9 added the following features:
#
# * New Background/Foreground Blocks: The classic rule0 is a special air block that respects the template's settings of
# preserve_water and preserve_lava. Not quite an air block, not quite a preserveBlock; there was no way to include such
# a block in other rules. Now there is, with the new background block:
#     rule19=0,100,stone,cobblestone,2*?air,gravel
# Any blocks can be made into background blocks by adding a "?" prefix before their names; the resultant background
# blocks will not replace air, blocks with hardcoded preservation (currently snow layers, webs, and plants), or any
# blocks protected by preserve_water or preserve_lava, if set. A "!" prefix does the opposite, creating a foreground
# block which ONLY replaces air and preserved blocks. Incidentally, the existing site leveling algorithm effectively
# uses background and foreground blocks for "flattening bumps" and "filling holes," respectively; these can now be
# explicitly used for greater control over how a structure blends into its surroundings.
#
# * rule0 used for Conditional Placeholder and Site Leveling: Previously, air blocks were used as placeholders to fill
# in for conditional rules before their conditions could be evaluated. Air blocks were also used to level the base of a
# structure site. This was problematic for partially or entirely submerged structures, leading to unsightly air
# pockets. Now rule0 is used instead. Consider using background water as an alternate rule0 for such templates:
#     preserve_water=1
#     =0,100,?water
# Similarly, a background lava rule0 might be used in more hellish climes.
#

=0,100,?air
rule1=0,100,preserveBlock
rule2=0,80,2*brick_block,dirt,stone,gravel
rule3=0,100,brick_block

^0,100,log-2
^0,100,log-1
rule5^2*0,90,planks-0
^0,80,planks-2
^0,70,planks-1


# LAYERS
# Each layer is a comma-delimited list of rules, one for each block.  There
# must be as many layers as the height, and each layer must have "layer" before
# the rules and end with "endlayer".  There are as many rows as the length, and
# as many rules as the width.  If you want the block blanked out use 0, which
# represents the background Air-block rule by default (but may be redefined).
