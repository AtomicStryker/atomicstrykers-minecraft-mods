#
# This file contains the Block Rotation Mappings Ruins might need
# <- lines starting with this symbol are considered comments and disregarded by the parser
# empty lines are allowed.
#
# To enable the Rotation of new or custom Blocks in Minecraft, you need to put Mappings
# for possible metadata occurences and the metadata after they have been rotated in a
# direction in here.
#
#
# Mappings are to follow this standard:
# First, the block ID must be given by the GameData.blockRegistry key
#
#
# If a multitude of Blocks share the same rotation logic, you can provide them all at once, seperated by semicoli.
# see stairs below
#
# Any mappings below such a line are considered part of that BlockID until another BlockID is introduced.
#
# A mapping is a Direction EAST, SOUTH or WEST, followed by the unrotated metadata, followed by the resulting metadata.
# These are seperated by '-'
#
# EAST-8-1
#
# That line means: if the Ruins Mod needs to rotate a Vine EAST, and the unrotated vine has metadata
# 8, the new metadata should be 1.
#
# You need to map any and all possible Rotations, with three Directions that aren't NORTH (= no rotation) and a
# Block that has 4 possible metadata values (such as Vines) that means you need to have 12 mappings.
#
# Other Blocks may have a lot more than that.
#
# Below, some mappings. Do not remove those! In the future, new mappings will be added in this file!
