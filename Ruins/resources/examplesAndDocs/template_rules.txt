# BASICS
# This file is designed to be copied into the mods/resources/ruins folder and be
# edited to create a new template.  It is functional as-is; you can use it as
# a placeholder for future templates after renaming it.
#
# Templates have a .tml extension and the mod will attempt to load any and
# all files with that extension if they reside in the <minecraft root>/
# mods/resources/ruins folder. Whether it does so successfully or not can be
# checked in the log file (<minecraft root>/mods/ruins_log.txt). The mod will also
# load any templates found in the biome folders within
# <minecraft root>/mods/resources/ruins.
#
# These template files are a simple text file; simply open them in your
# favorite text editor to make changes or create new ones.
#
# There are three sections to each template file:
# VARIABLES define how the template is generated.
# BLOCK RULES define how the layers are generated.
# LAYERS tells the mod how to place blocks using BLOCK RULES.
#
# You can specify a comment by placing a "#" character at the beginning of the
# line.  You technically /don't/ have to do this, since the mod only looks for
# particular line starts when loading a template, but I consider it good form 
# because it increases readability and you prevent any errant line reads.


# VARIABLES
#
# biomesToSpawnIn=<name1>,<name2>,<name3>...
# Adds the Template being loaded (regardless which folder it is in) to a Ruins Biome
# found in the Minecraft Biomelist so that <namex> matches the Biome's name.
# If you don't know a Biome's name, find it's folder. The foldername equals the
# Biome name. Case insensitive. A Template cannot be added to a Biome more than once.
# The Template is still added to the corresponding folder it was loaded from (if not already in).
# example: biomesToSpawnIn=forest,foresthills,taiga
# Optional. You can use the folders as before, or use this to save space, or both.
#
# weight=<weight>
# Weight is how much weight this template has during random generation.  When
# the mod asks for a template to place it adds up the weights of all templates
# that are currently loaded and generates a random number based off of that
# total, then checks to see what template to load.  If the mod loads five
# templates with weights 1, 5, 5, 10 and 10, the template with weight 10 has a
# 10 in 31 chance of being generated, while the template with weight 1 has a 1
# in 31 chance of being generated.  A template only has weight in its biome.
# Defaults to 1.
#
# unique=<yes/no>
# If this is set to 1:
# If the template is generic, it can only ever be generated once per world.
# If the template is biome-specific, it can only ever be generated once in the
# biome per world (so you could duplicate it to other biome folders).
# Defaults to 0 (no).
#
# embed_into_distance=<number of layers>
# Specifies how many layers to embed into the target blocks.  This is useful
# for creating basements or dungeons.
# Defaults to 1.
#
# acceptable_target_blocks=<blockID>,<blockID>,<etc...>
# This is a comma-delimited list of block IDs that this template can spawn on.
# Only the top layer of blocks where the template will spawn are checked.
# Optional line. Defaults to accept any block.
#
# unacceptable_target_blocks=<blockID>,<blockID>,<etc...>
# This is a comma-delimited list of block IDs that this template can NOT spawn on.
# Only the top layer of blocks where the template will spawn are checked.
# Optional line. Defaults to accept any block.
#
# dimensions=<height>,<width>,<length>
# Defines how big this template is.  Height is the number         n
# of layers that are used, not the height that sticks out         n
# above the ground.  Width is the north-south width, and       www*eee
# length is the east-west width.  For reference, north in         s
# the template is the top of the text file.                       s
# All default to 0.
#
# allowable_overhang=<overhang>
# Specifies the allowed number of blocks in the potential build site that do not have
# a surface within a reasonable distance, leaving the template "hanging" over an edge
# Defaults to 0.
#
# max_leveling=<leveling>
# Specifies the maximum surface noise / height difference, within the build site,
# that will be accepted when considering a potential build location.
# The site will then be levelled prior to spawning the template.
# If there is overhang allowed, also specifies how much "support" blocks are put
# under the template when building it overlapping a surface edge.
# Defaults to 2.
#
# leveling_buffer=<lbuffer>
# The distance around the build site that will also be levelled.  Values higher
# than 5 will use 5, since the world would otherwise be mangled pretty badly.
# Defaults to 0.
# Ruins 12.8 introduces a setting of -1, which will prevent any(!) site leveling
#
# preserve_water=<yes/no>
# If set to 1 all site checking rules will treat water as air so that the ruin
# can be generated beneath/in water.  Any rules that replace a block with air
# will respect water and not replace it.  If set to 0, water is treated like 
# any other block.
# Defaults to 0/no.
#
# preserve_lava=<yes/no>
# If set to 1 all site checking rules will treat lava as air so that the ruin
# can be generated beneath/in lava.  Any rules that replace a block with air
# will respect lava and not replace it.  If set to 0, lava is treated like 
# any other block.
# Defaults to 0/no.
#
# preserve_plants=<yes/no>
# If set to 1 all site checking rules will treat trees, leaves, and cactus as
# air so that the ruin can be generated in and around them.  Any rules that
# replace a block with air will respect trees, leaves, and cactus and not
# replace them.  If set to 0, trees, leaves, and cactus are treated like 
# any other blocks.  Cactus adjacent to other blocks will break down, so you
# may not actually see cactus in your structure.
# Defaults to 0/no
#
# random_height_offset=<min>,<max>
# Specifies block range in which the Ruin will be randomly shifted up or down
# on an established valid location before actually being built.
# Defaults to 0,0/no random shifting
#
# NOTE: When using preserve_water and preserve_lava it is advised that you
# restrict the cut_in_buffer as much as possible, preferably to 0.  If it is
# more than 0 you may get some unexpected fluid dynamics if the structure
# does not spawn completely in water/lava.
#
# Ruins 13.8 adds optional variable "uniqueMinDistance" which overrides global templateInstancesMinDistance
# uniqueMinDistance=1500
# defaults to 0. values of 0 are handled as if no value was specified at all.

# BLOCK RULES
# Each rule must be formatted carefully:
# rule<number>=<condition>,<chance to appear>,<list of blocks>
#
# rule<number>
# The mod does not care what you call these and will number the rules in the
# order they are loaded (sequentially from 1), so long as the line start with
# "rule".  I suggest using "rule#" as a mnemonic, such as "rule1", "rule2",
# "rule12", etc...  Once the templates are loaded, the first rule in the list
# becomes rule #1 for the purposes of building a layer, the second becomes rule
# #2, and so on.
#
# The mod uses a special rule, 0, which defines the Air block with a 100% spawn
# rate and no conditional.  You can use this rule in the layers to "blank out"
# certain areas (providing space for mobs, for instance).
#
# <condition>
# A conditional to the block being placed, aside from randomness.
# 0 = Normal, spawns first
# ±1 = Checks block under, spawns delayed
# ±2 = Checks block adjacent, spawns delayed
# ±3 = Checks block above, spawns last
# 7 = Spawns last
# Where the negative cases for 1,2,3 denote NOT. In other words, 2 means the block will only spawn 
# if there is a block next to it, while -2 will NOT spawn if there are any blocks next to it.
#
# Adjacent in this case is not diagonal, only along the cardinal directions.
#
# Adjacent blocks are processed after 0 and 1 conditionals have been placed,
# and "under blocks" are processed after all other blocks have been placed.
# Please note that these blocks are still processed in an order dependent on
# the rotation of the site.  For a normal, north-facing site, the block rules
# are processed for each line from the left and from the bottom template to the
# top.
#
# DO NOT CHAIN CONDITIONS. That results in undefined behaviour.
#
# <chance to appear>
# The chance that this block will appear, out of 100, depending on whether the
# condition above is met.
#
# <list of blocks>
# A comma-delimited set of minecraft blockIDs.  This will determine what block
# will actually spawn in the location.  Each blockID is given the same weight,
# so you can skew the odds of a certain blockID appearing by adding it multiple
# times.  You can specify block metadata by adding a "-<metadata>" after the
# blockID.  For instance, to place a cobblestone stairs block ascending to the
# east, use stone_stairs-3.  To place a wood half-block (slab), use stone_slab-2.
#
# You can find a list of blockIDs and commonly-used metadata via Google.
# There is also one included, idmappings.txt
#
#
# Example 1: rule1=0,100,0,cobblestone,mossy_cobblestone
# This spawns either air, cobblestone, or a mossy cobblestone 100% of the time.
#
# Example 2: rule1=1,50,mossy_cobblestone
# This spawns a mossy cobblestone 50% of the time but only if another block
# is underneath it.
#
# Example 3: rule1=2,100,stone_slab-2,planks
# This spawns either a stone slab or a plank block, but only if there is an
# adjacent block on the same level.
#
# Example 4: rule1=0,100,torch-5
# This spawns a torch standing on the ground.
#
# Example 5: rule1=0,25,MediumChest
# This spawns a Medium Chest (see above) 25% of the time.
#
# Example 6: rule1=0,50,MobSpawner:Villager
# This spawns a Mob Spawner with Entity Id "Villager" 50% of the time
# Entity Id's are case sensitive! Mod added Mobs are allowed. Use a tool like Simply Hax to get correct Entity Id's
#
# Ruins 9.0 exposes minecraft ChestGenHook for your meddling. Usage:
#
# Example 7: rule1=0,100,ChestGenHook:dungeonChest:10
# This spawns a chest and tells the Minecraft generator to fill it with "10" items of the "dungeonChest" preset.
# This might include extremely powerful items added by mods.
#
#	here is the complete list (as of mc 1.4.7) of ChestGen presets:
#   "mineshaftCorridor"; "pyramidDesertyChest"; "pyramidJungleChest"; "pyramidJungleDispenser"; "strongholdCorridor";
#   "strongholdLibrary"; "strongholdCrossing"; "villageBlacksmith"; "bonusChest"; "dungeonChest";
#
#	As of 10.6, all chest rules can also append a metadata/rotation int similar to a chest block ID
#	example: rule1=0,100,ChestGenHook:dungeonChest:10-5
#	for a chest filled with dungeon loot and rotated to meta 5.
#
#
# Ruins 10.3 adds Command Block Support. Usage:
# Example 8: rule1=0,100,CommandBlock:command:sender
# command being the Command string to be executed and sender being the Command sender (a player name, Rcon...)
#
# Ruins 12.1 adds Standing Signs. Usage:
# Example 9: rule1=0,100,StandingSign:a|b|c|d-4
# a,b,c,d are the 4 Strings/lines you can write on a sign. The metadata/rotation of the sign is affixed as usual.
#
# Ruins 12.2 adds IInventory block support. Usage: IInventory;<blockName>;<itemList>-<blockrotation>
# where <blockName> is the registry name of the Block that sports an inventory
# where <itemList> is a list of elements seperated by '+', each element is a block or item registry name
# optionally followed by #stacksize OR #stacksize#metadata OR #stacksize#metadata#inventoryslot
# Example 10: rule1=0,100,IInventory;chest;red_flower+arrow#10+wool#3#15-5
# this spawns a chest rotated to 5, which will contain a single red flower, 10 arrows, and 3 wool of color red (meta 15)
# Example 11: rule1=0,100,IInventory;dispenser;arrow#10+snowball#20+egg#3-1
# this spawns a dispenser rotated to 1, with 10 arrows 20 snowballs and 3 eggs
# you may use this for items added by mods. names not found in the registry will simply be skipped over.
# you may also use this for container blocks added by mods. invalid anythings should be skipped.
# the Ruins Parser will do this for you when you parse an IInventory block. Empty chests get hooked with dungeon loot
# automatically. If you want to prevent this, either edit the template afterwards or place some dirt in the chest.
# if you specify the same slot index multiple times, only the first itemstack gets put in
#

rule1=0,100,preserveBlock
rule2=0,80,brick_block,brick_block,dirt,stone,gravel
rule3=0,100,brick_block


# LAYERS
# Each layer is a comma-delimited list of rules, one for each block.  There
# must be as many layers as the height, and each layer must have "layer" before
# the rules and end with "endlayer".  There are as many rows as the length, and
# as many rules as the width.  If you want the block blanked out use 0, which
# represents the Air-block rule.
