		- Advanced Machines can now be turned with a Wrench
		- KNOWN ISSUE: Sometimes Rotation does not Update immediatly, but only after a time or when the machine is switched on
		- KNOWN ISSUE: Upon placing an Advanced Machine the client can crash with an "internal server error", nothing happens on server. Just relog and it should be fine

		current recipes:
		- 64 Iron Ore + 1 Coal = 128 refined Iron Dust
		- 3 Copper Ore + 1 Tin Ore = 8 Bronze Dust [Works with any Forge library Copper and Tin]
		- 8 Coal + 1 Water Cell = 8 Hydrated Coal Dust
		once additive Macerating has started, any attempt to remove the second Input Item will result in one of it's stack being left behind. It its only a single Stack, clicking it purges the slot.
	
	fixed Shift clicking. Upgrades now automatically land in the Upgrade Slots, anything else in Input, shift clicking on machine content always puts in inventory

	_DANGER EXPLOSIONS_ Changed base Tier to 1 (Low Voltage) _DANGER EXPLOSIONS_
	Existing idle Advanced Machines hooked up to Medium Voltage won't explode. Working ones WILL.

	Cut down base max Energy Input to 32 EU/t, from 128
	Cut down base max Speed and Energy Storage by half, to 5000
	-> so to make Upgrades actually useful

	Change to Energy Cost: Once Full Speed is reached, the additional cost from Overclockers is nullified

	Added missing sprites
	Fixed Voltage Explosion bug when introducing Transformers into a non charged Machine
	Dramatically reduced Tick Load by checking Upgrade Inventory only when it has changed (IC2 does it at all times ... lol)

		customizable Texture and Sound config
		a different Texture when a machine is working (may not work in SMP)
		Particles!
		Extractor has 3 output Slots again, reworked all GUIs for vertical output slots

	Default values are compatible with prior versions, your config should contain the new stuff after running once.
