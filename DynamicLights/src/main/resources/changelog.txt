1.20.4.1
- updated to MC 1.20.4

1.20.1.2
- fixes missing model logspam on boot, thanks Tfarcenim from Github

1.20.1.1
- you can now configure itemstacks to ignore nbt tag equality, to shine light from items that could be
  enchanted or damaged. example: {anyNbtMatch:true,lightLevel:14s,nameId:\"minecraft:flint_and_steel\"}
  the important part is adding anyNbtMatch:true to the tag list

1.20.1.0
- updated to MC 1.20.1

1.19.4.1
- updated to MC 1.19.4

1.18.6
- courtesy of https://github.com/thraaawn, dynamic light source strength is once again configurable
- there is also NBT tags other mods can use to signal dynamic lights to make it shine
- see https://github.com/AtomicStryker/atomicstrykers-minecraft-mods/pull/425
- minor code cleanup, improve player water handling

1.18.5
- another hopeful fix for same deadlock problem

1.18.4
- fix possible deadlock when loading a worlsave with dropped light source entities

1.18.3
- if the light sources current position cannot be lit up, now try the adjacent blocks aswell
- if movement brought a light source into un-lightable passable blocks (like plants), the light will remain active at the last viable location
- this means dynamic lights will now work much better when moving through plants/snow and similar

1.18.2
- reduced log level for everything but config reading failure to debug, it was spammy

1.18.1
- updated for MC 1.18

1.17.1
- updated for MC 1.17.1 and the official source mappings

1.16.5
- rewritten to work with MC 1.16.5
- the mod now uses fake air and water blocks to achieve light (rapidly placing and removing them as light sources move)
- this has several limitations, only full water blocks can emit dynamic lights (not waterfalls or partial block rivers)
- it will also not work if the light source is inside some non-air block like foliage or spiderwebs
- the mod is now a "standard" mod that requires both a client and a server to have it when playing online
- currently only the player self light and dropped items modules are implemented
