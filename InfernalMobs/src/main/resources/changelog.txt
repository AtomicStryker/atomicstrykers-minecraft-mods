- Values of 3, 5, 10 would mean one out of 3 Mobs gets Rare, of those Rares one out of 5 becomes Ultra, of those Ultras one out of 10 becomes Infernal
- absolute chances for an Infernal then: 1/3 * 1/5 * 1/10 = 1/150 one out of 150 Mobs gets Infernal

- Blocks are added similar, "blockID-metaValue-stackSize", example "35-4-10" is 10 Blocks of yellow Wool (id 35, meta 4)
- meta and stacksize need not be specified and default to 0 and 1
- instead of a numeric ID you may also use the code name, example "tile.cloth-4-10" is the same Wool as above
- this may help with mod items or blocks whose IDs are subject to change
