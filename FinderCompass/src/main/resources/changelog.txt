and more code for Optifine, yay
holding needle length calculation together with duct tape at this point

Finder Compass now has a texture file for each resolution at /mods/findercompass/textures/items/compass*.png

updated to MC 1.5.1 and the new MC Texture System
Finder Compass now has a texture file at /mods/findercompass/textures/items/compass.png
If you have a texture pack and want high-res Finder compass, it needs to override that file!!!
Finder Compass now needs an Item ID (to setup a fake/real texture)
if you so desire, it can also be an actual craftable Item (see new FinderCompassItemConfig.cfg)
if the Item is enabled, the standard compass remains unchanged (server authority)
the Item recipe is a compass in middle, plus diamonds on all 4 sides
Finder Compass (Item or hack) uses an included 32x texture

to override clients, simply install your config on the server like you would on client
